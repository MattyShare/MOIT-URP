- QUICK START :
1. In a Unity 6 URP project,
2. Open the Project Settings, Tags and Layers tab, and add a TransparentMOIT layer in any available User Layer. You can make more according to your project's needs.
3. Find your Universal Renderer Data and add a Moment Based Order Independent Transparency Feature.
4. Assign the MOIT Settings and Bias Settings scriptable objects in the Feature. There are examples in the MOIT folder. The bias settings use the recommended values from the paper.
5. Assign the layer(s) you created at step 2 in the MOITSettings Layer Mask field and remove them from the Transparent Layer Mask on your Universal Renderer Data.
This will prevent drawing transparent objects twice, once as MOIT and once as normal transparent.
6. Any transparent object must be on the TransparentMOIT layer(s) to be rendered by the MOIT Feature. If not, they will be rendered as normal transparent (if they have a forward pass)
